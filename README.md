# Turboscript

A programming language same as typescript but compiled directly to machine code
to fasten speed performance and compilation time also.

## Build

To be build this project, you need to have `CMake` and any C++ compiler
installed on your computer. Then run following command from the project root:

```sh
cmake -B build
```

This command will generate necessary build files in the `build` directory. Then
run following command to actually build the project.

```sh
make -C build

# This is equivalent to this:
cd build
make .
```

This will generate an executable file in the `bin` directory.
